      <p>When it comes to the school and our community, I wish that there was some way for more children to be able to use technology at home when it is needed. I also wish that the school was more focused on technology and the cloud so that we could have a more central place for all our work, grades, and projects to be stored. </p>

      <p> I also wish that students were able to have more access to work on projects when it is not on computers. Some type of club should be able to be opened so that students coud come in and do class and home work if need be, that is opened both earlier and later than the library so that is more time to finish said work. </p>
