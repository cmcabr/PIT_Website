      <h3>The Next Generation</h3>
      <p>One message I would want to share with a wider audience would be to be optimistic when it comes to the newer generation; specifically, I wish for many to have more faith in the work the students of today and of what they could achieve. Yes, there are idiots within our age, but then again, there are idiots in every group, and just because a few people in our age group are idiots doesn't mean we all are idiots. And for those idiots, they just need to be pushed to do better and work harder, and to learn to have the work ethic to do so.</p>

      <p> Another message I would like to share originates from an English essay written a week ago by me. The following quote teaches the gratefulness we should have for our guides of life.</p>
      <q>A leader is not one of just intelligence and creativity. It is not one of critical thinking. It is not one of just business and obedience. A leader must be able to fulfill all of these requirements; they must be able to have the work ethic to keep even the smallest of organizations or the largest of nations at peace and focus. They must have the intellectual strength to find their own viewpoint in any situation and be able to back up what their viewpoint is with astonishing evidence and information sources. They must have the right mind to be able to make the right decisions on what is the best solution based on said viewpoint and the beliefs of the people he is using this solution for. Where is the one place where you would learn this? Simple. Our guides are revealed to us every day as we walk into the front doors of our public schools.
