      <ul>
        <li>Autocorrect can be enabled or disabled, making it easy to type a correct essay and learn from your mistakes, or do a blind typing test. </li>
        <li>You have a built-in dictionary and thesaurus, both online and within Microsoft Word, making it easy to find better terms to expand upon your writing, or learn new words to use more often.</li>
        <li>Cloud storage can hold as many documents as you need, meaning yoou no longer lose any important homework or essays because your dog ripped it up or it got wet...unless you forget to save.</li>
        <li>If you use online file sharing, you won't need any paper or pencils for class. Just a single tablet or laptop.</li>
      </ul>
